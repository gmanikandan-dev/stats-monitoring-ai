I have an application for reward system.I have used mongodb db.
In this application, we can create a two rule.
1)100 points to create an account. 
2)50 points to ordered product.


I prepared csv statistics for the given rules once daily.
Here, csv is a input.
Below is the example csv format.

The report 2025-02-02 for store (client_name) 1001 | | |
Points Earning Rules| | |
Create an account | Earning value = 100 points | Limit of 1 per day |
Daily Activity Data: | | |
New Accounts Created Today: 1 customers created accounts today. | | |
Total Points Awarded for Account Creation: 100 points. | | |

here, | is the column.

I am taking tenant based csv daily. I am taking 20-30 csv daily.

I'm expecting you to provide me with a solution to feed data to LLM and get answer from LLM.
Like, 
Which tenant has more points overall?
Which tenant has lower points overall?
List week1 all tenant points.
List week2 all tenant points.


Need to implement POC in my local system with efficiency, quality and scalability.
