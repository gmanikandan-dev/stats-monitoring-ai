I have an application for reward system.I have used mongodb db.
In this application, we can create a two rule.
1)100 points to create an account. 
2)50 points to ordered product.


I prepared csv statistics for the given rules once daily.
Here, csv is a input.

CSV Input format look this,

'tenant_name': "Roman corporate",
'date': "2023-06-01",
'new_accounts': 1,
'account_points': 100,
'total_account_points': 100,
'orders': 5,
'order_points': 50,
'total_order_points': 250,
'total_points': 350

I am taking tenant based csv daily. I am taking 20-30 csv daily.

I'm expecting you to provide me with a solution to feed data to LLM and get answer from LLM.
Like, 
Which tenant has more points overall?
Which tenant has lower points overall?
List week1 all tenant points.
List week2 all tenant points.

use LangChain,RAG and LLM technology.
Need to implement POC in my local system with efficiency, quality and scalability.
