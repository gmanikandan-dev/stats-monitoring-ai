I have an application for reward system.I have used mongodb db.
In this application, we can create a two rule.
1)100 points to create an account. 
2)50 points to ordered product.


I prepared csv statistics for the given rules once daily.
Here, csv is a input.

CSV Input format look this,

'tenant_name': "Roman corporate",
'date': "2023-06-01",
'new_accounts': 1,
'account_points': 100,
'total_account_points': 100,
'orders': 5,
'order_points': 50,
'total_order_points': 250,
'total_points': 350

I am taking tenant based csv daily. I am taking 20-30 csv daily.

I'm expecting you to provide me with a solution to feed data to LLM and get answer from LLM.
Like, 
Which tenant has more points overall?
Which tenant has lower points overall?
List week1 all tenant points.
List week2 all tenant points.

use LangChain,RAG and LLM technology.
Need to implement POC in my local system with efficiency, quality and scalability.


tenant_name	date	new_accounts	account_points	total_account_points
AAA store	01-03-2025	1	100	100
BBB store	01-03-2025	2	50	100
CCC store	01-03-2025	1	500	500



AAA store	02-03-2025	2	100	200
BBB store	02-03-2025	1	50	50
CCC store	02-03-2025	1	500	500


AAA store	03-03-2025	5	100	500
BBB store	03-03-2025	4	50	200
CCC store	03-03-2025	2	500	1000


AAA store	04-03-2025	1	100	100
BBB store	04-03-2025	1	50	50

AAA store	05-03-2025	1	100	100
BBB store	05-03-2025	1	50	50
CCC store	05-03-2025	3	500	500

# Scope 1

In my laravel scheduler prepare and store the csv on s3. 
I want to automate the below steps using python with latest AI technologies.
Scope:
mongod db: reward_system
collection : tenant_rewards (id,url,file_name)

The url is available in the collection.

Daily basis automaticaly read the csv files.
Input csv file has following columns
tenant_name: AAA store
date : 01-03-2025
new_accounts: 1
account_points: 100
total_account_points: 100

here, we need to validate the total_account_points using below formula
total_account_points=(new_accounts*account_points)

Just validate each and every records. If you find the incorrect value just send mail to manikandan.g@targetbay.com with details like tenant_name and date

To give me the suggestion to build that AI agent with cost effective technologies and to implement the POC in my local machine. 



# Scope 2

To build a AI Agent to validate the csv files daily basis
Input csv file has the following columns with multiple rows

tenant_name: AAA store 

date : 01-03-2025 

new_accounts: 1 

account_points: 100 

total_account_points: 100

In future,

new_orders: 2

order_points: 200

total_order_points: 400

Here, we need to validate 

total_account_points is equal to multiplication of new_accounts and account_points

total_order_points is equal to multiplication of new_orders and order_points

just validate the each and every rows and find out the incorrect tenant_name and date. Then send that details via email (example@gmail.com)


# Scope 3
I've csv files each file has only 1 row with multiple columns.
It is a reward system conditions.

The column and row like
new_account : 4
account_points: 20
total_account_points: 80
new_orders: 3
order_points: 50
total_account_points: 150

What are the AI methods/tech to check the following condition with cost effective
Rule: Reported total points should be equal to (new_accounts * account_points).
Rule:Reported total order points should be equal to (new_orders * order_points).
